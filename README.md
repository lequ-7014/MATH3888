# MATH3888

CYC2008 is a gold standard dataset of 408 yeast complexes.
yeast_cleaner: Preprocessed the 4932_protein_links_full_v12_0.txt network
cluster_test: Tested the 5 complex detection algorithms against the gold standard
Centrality_Notebook_Final_Portfolio: Used centrality measures on the clusters generated by DPClus to find significant proteins
Centrality-Scores-Final-Portfoilio: Used edge weight metric on the clusters generated by DPClus to find significant proteins
